# Food-Order-Management-using-C

Food Order Management using C is a project made in 2020. This includes taking user input for name, ph.no, and order. It is programmed to eliminate all the possible errors that a customer can make while ordering like mistake in ph.no, to order more, to get the bill or to re-order. At last it is also programmed to take the coupon input from the user and give 10% discount on the total price
